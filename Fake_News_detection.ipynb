It is the role of judges to apply, not alter, the work of the people\\u2019s representatives.

I think of them tonight. Of course, the Supreme Court\\u2019s work is vital not just to a region of the country, but to the whole, vital to the protection of people\\u2019s liberties under law, and to the continuity of our Constitution, the greatest charter of human liberty the world has ever known. \\u201d He further said former Justices Antonin Scalia and Robert Jackson were \\u201ctowering judges\\u201d and Scalia was \\u201ca lion of the law. \\u201d He also praised Justice Byron White, who he worked for, as \\u201cone of the smartest and most courageous men I\\u2019ve ever known. \\u201d Gorsuch also praised Justice Kennedy, who he clerked for, as a man who taught him \\u201cso much. \\u201d Gorsuch further stated, \\u201c[W]hen we judges don our robes, it doesn\\u2019t make us any smarter, but it does serve as a reminder of what\\u2019s expected of us: impartiality and independence, collegiality, and courage. As this process now moves to the Senate, I look forward [to] speaking with members from both sides of the aisle, to answering their questions, and to hearing their concerns. I consider the United States Senate the greatest deliberative body in the world, and I respect the important role the constitution affords it in the confirmation of our judges. I respect, too, the fact that in our legal order, it is for Congress and not the courts to write new laws. It is the role of judges to apply, not alter, the work of the people\\u2019s representatives.

The idea is, that if they can incite Trump supporters and get it on video, it will help them to push a false narrative that Trump supporters are  violent.  Watch him brag about being an  intermediary  between super PACs for Hillary and the DNC. This guy is like a stupid mobster who can t help himself, telling a perfect stranger where all the bodies are buried Watch him explain in detail how they have paid operatives who will show up at Trump events or Trump owned entities to stir up hate. They actually have  agitator training  who help people who work for them understand how to best get a reaction from Trump supporters. Watch Hillary push the false narrative,  Trump supporters are violent  that the underbelly of the Democratic Party is secretly creating through a seedy network of criminal minds:Here s a great example of how Democrats organize to create chaos and incite violence with Trump supporters. The entire time this Trump supporter is trying to answer an interviewers question, this anti-Trump protester is blowing a whistle in his face. Yet again, when a Trump supporter is  being interviewed, (likely paid) agitators are constantly spinning noise makers inches from his face. It s clear they are trying to incite these Trump supporters to commit an act of violence on camera. ***Warning***this video could significantly increase your blood pressure:\",\n          \"BUENOS AIRES  - The victory of Argentine President Mauricio Macri s coalition in midterm elections on Sunday marked a resounding defeat of Peronism, one of Latin America s best-known political movements, leaving it divided and with no clear leader. In particular, a win by Macri s candidate over former President Cristina Fernandez in Buenos Aires province, the cradle of Peronism, diminishes her chances of returning to the presidency in 2019 and opens the door to a new era of business friendly reforms. While it is too soon to call the end of Peronism as a political force, the  Let s Change  movement founded by Macri, a former businessman and soccer mogul, has introduced a generation of new politicians who are less interested in dwelling on the emotion and imagery of Argentina s past than their predecessors.  We know that if we win, there will be renewal in Congress, but above all that people will accept that the country has changed,  Macri s chief campaign strategist Jaime Duran Barba said in a recent interview ahead of the election. He pointed to Buenos Aires governor, 44-year-old Maria Eugenia Vidal, and 51-year-old Buenos Aires City Mayor, Horacio Rodriguez Larreta, both from Macri s coalition, as examples of the leaders of the future. Macri s coalition won close to 42 percent of the national vote on Sunday, when Argentina elected a third of the Senate and half the lower chamber. That still leaves Macri short of a majority in Congress but new alliances should enable him to pass tax, capital market and labor reforms. Fernandez, who succeeded her late husband Nestor Kirchner in 2007, won two presidential elections thanks to nationalist appeals and generous social welfare programs.  She drew comparisons to Eva Peron, whose support for the country s poor means she is still adored by many working class Argentines 65 years after her death.  Evita,  as she is known worldwide, was the wife of General Juan Peron, the founder of the Peronist movement. Focused on workers  rights, its economic policies have veered from protectionist to free-market and it defies easy classification. In different forms, it has been Argentina s dominant political force since the 1940s. Argentina s electoral list system guaranteed Fernandez a Senate seat and some political influence with her second-place finish, but she lost by more than four percentage points to Macri s little-known former education minister in the bellwether province that is home to nearly 40 percent of voters. In October, 57 percent of Buenos Aires province citizens said they would never vote for Fernandez, according to a poll by Management & Fit. Pollster Poliarquia said that, nationwide, 53 percent of Argentines have a negative view of Fernandez, while 30 percent have a positive view.  Many Argentines blame Fernandez for isolating them economically with protectionist policies and cutting the country off from international capital markets. Now the center of a number of corruption investigations, Fernandez personally denies committing graft, though she admits there may have been corruption in her government.   Peronism today is rebuilding itself, leaving behind a very negative era,  said Enrique Zuleta Puceiro, director of pollster OPSM.  There are not any leaders with high levels of national influence.  With less clout in Congress, moderate Peronist governors are weighing joining Macri s reform agenda or abandoning their political careers. They have distanced themselves from Fernandez, who formed a new party for the election. Macri told Reuters in August that he could negotiate with a new generation of Peronist governors like Juan Manuel Urtubey of Salta and Sergio Unac of San Juan, who worked with him to reach an agreement to cut spending.  If Peronism does not renew itself it is destined to disappear,  Urtubey told Perfil newspaper, before his coalition in Salta lost heavily to Macri s allies in the election. Since taking office in late 2015, Macri has worked to literally dismantle Peronist symbols, taking down portraits and closing museums to get rid of their cultural legacies. However, given its historical weight and habit of renovation, most analysts say it is too soon to write Peronism s obituary.  Giving up Peronism for dead, thinking it will remain fragmented and confused until 2019, I believe is an error,  said Marcos Buscaglia, founding partner at Buenos Aires political and economic consultancy Alberdi Partners.  Paula Alonso, director of the Latin American and Hemispheric Studies Program at George Washington University, said Argentina s former Peronist leaders - including Peron himself, Carlos Menem, and the Kirchners - had generally risen swiftly to power from relative obscurity.      It s unpredictable in many ways, and therefore it is always relevant,  she said.\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"unreliable\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"number\",\n        \"std\": 0,\n        \"min\": 0,\n        \"max\": 1,\n        \"num_unique_values\": 2,\n        \"samples\": [\n          0,\n          1\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"author\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"category\",\n        \"num_unique_values\": 1,\n        \"samples\": [\n          \"Unknown\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    }\n  ]\n}"

Speaking of discussions with the chamber\\u2019s Republican majority about a bill to help Puerto Rico deal with its $70 billion debt, she said: \\u201cI don\\u2019t see they\\u2019re dragging it out. I think this is a legitimate process on the part of the Republicans.\\u201d\",\n          \"Politico reported Thursday that President Donald Trump, chastened by his experience pushing for the failed Ryancare bill, is moving forward on tax reform with is own economic team in the lead \\u2014  not Speaker Paul Ryan ( ):[Just on Thursday, President Donald Trump huddled with Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin, National Economic Council Director Gary Cohn, senior strategist Steve Bannon,    and consigliere Jared Kushner and staffers from the National Economic Council and Treasury to delve into the various policy   and ways to structure a plan. The key takeaway: The White House is not outsourcing these details to anyone, including the speaker of the House. The report said White House press secretary Sean Spicer confirmed this new dynamic at Friday\\u2019s news briefing: \\u201cThe president will put out principles, I\\u2019m sure, in terms of what his goals are and drive this as the process moves forward. \\u201d  A   paper, obtained by Politico and developed during the presidential transition, is the central blueprint for the president\\u2019s tax reform program \\u2014  and it would push Ryan\\u2019s own Border Adjustment Tax off the table. The president is expected to propose cutting the corporate tax rate to 15 percent combined with a wiping out of the tax code\\u2019s catalog of tax loopholes and deductions Congress created to ameliorate the 35 percent rate for business profits. Another part of the plan is to simply the individual tax rates, again by lowering the rates and removing specialized deductions. Trump\\u2019s corporate and individual tax reforms are significant, but no way near the revolutionary changes contained in Ryan\\u2019s Border Adjustment Tax, which shifts $1 trillion in annual tax burden onto exported goods and exporters. That fight has already been going on behind the scenes, as domestic manufacturers and retailers line up allies and resources as they contest for who will be on the hook for   of the federal government\\u2019s annual revenues. Ryan read Capitol Hill Republicans into his   schedule that would carry on through Labor Day at the GOP lawmakers\\u2019 policy retreat held in Philadelphia in the last week of January. The schedule called for the House to focus on overturning President Barack Obama\\u2019s   regulations through the Congressional Review Act, while the Senate focused on confirming the first wave of Trump administration appointees. March was dedicated to the    of the 2010 Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, or Obamacare. In April, the Senate would confirm the president\\u2019s choice to fill the Supreme Court seat made vacant by the death of Justice Antonin Scalia, and the House would tackle reforming the tax code \\u2014  a process coupled with the approval of the fiscal year 2018 budget that would consume both chambers. In Philadelphia, Ryan had not yet revealed that he would hijack the    of Obamacare with his own bill that fell short of what Republicans had expected and had promised voters in every political cycle since Obamacare became law in 2010. The Ryancare bill alienated conservatives and frightened moderate Republicans hesitant to cast a politically risky vote for a bill that might not pass the Senate. In the end, the speaker pulled the Ryancare bill from the House floor March 24, nearly 15 minutes from the roll call that would have meant its certain defeat. If Ryan had a working majority in the House, he would be the man driving the agenda, he but does not have that majority, so the White House is moving forward with its own agenda and its own ideas. The aborted American Health Care Act has been portrayed as a defeat for the president, who rallied for the bill in   events outside of Washington and behind closed doors at the White House and on Capitol Hill. Now that things have settled, it appears that instead of a setback for the president, the failure of the speaker\\u2019s health care legislation was really Trump\\u2019s liberation. During the 2016 presidential cycle, Ryan created \\u201cThe Better Way\\u201d agenda as a parallel campaign platform, so that he and his allies could campaign for themselves without mentioning the president\\u2019s name nor offer him support. Now, Trump has found his own better way.\",\n          \"After the announcement of his nomination to the US Supreme Court on Tuesday, Judge Neil Gorsuch praised former Justice Antonin Scalia as a \\u201clion of the law. \\u201d And stated, \\u201cit is for Congress and not the courts to write new laws. It is the role of judges to apply, not alter, the work of the people\\u2019s representatives. A judge who likes every outcome he reaches is very likely a bad judge, stretching for results he prefers rather than those the law demands. \\u201d  Gorsuch said, \\u201cI pledge that if I am confirmed, I will do all my powers permit to be a faithful servant of the Constitution and laws of this great country. \\u201d Gorsuch then talked about his experience on the bench, saying that he\\u2019s been inspired by the judges he worked with who he has watched \\u201cfearlessly tending to the rule of law, enforcing the promises of our Constitution, and living out daily their judicial oaths to administer justice equally to rich and poor alike, following the law as they find it and without respect to their personal political beliefs. I think of them tonight. Of course, the Supreme Court\\u2019s work is vital not just to a region of the country, but to the whole, vital to the protection of people\\u2019s liberties under law, and to the continuity of our Constitution, the greatest charter of human liberty the world has ever known. \\u201d He further said former Justices Antonin Scalia and Robert Jackson were \\u201ctowering judges\\u201d and Scalia was \\u201ca lion of the law. \\u201d He also praised Justice Byron White, who he worked for, as \\u201cone of the smartest and most courageous men I\\u2019ve ever known. \\u201d Gorsuch also praised Justice Kennedy, who he clerked for, as a man who taught him \\u201cso much. \\u201d Gorsuch further stated, \\u201c[W]hen we judges don our robes, it doesn\\u2019t make us any smarter, but it does serve as a reminder of what\\u2019s expected of us: impartiality and independence, collegiality, and courage. As this process now moves to the Senate, I look forward [to] speaking with members from both sides of the aisle, to answering their questions, and to hearing their concerns. I consider the United States Senate the greatest deliberative body in the world, and I respect the important role the constitution affords it in the confirmation of our judges. I respect, too, the fact that in our legal order, it is for Congress and not the courts to write new laws. It is the role of judges to apply, not alter, the work of the people\\u2019s representatives. A judge who likes every outcome he reaches is very likely a bad judge, stretching for results he prefers rather than those the law demands. \\u201d Follow Ian Hanchett on Twitter @IanHanchett\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"unreliable\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"number\",\n        \"std\": 0,\n        \"min\": 0,\n        \"max\": 1,\n        \"num_unique_values\": 2,\n        \"samples\": [\n          0,\n          1\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"author\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"category\",\n        \"num_unique_values\": 865,\n        \"samples\": [\n          \"LN Buzz Team\",\n          \"Terry\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    }\n  ]\n}"

It is the role of judges to apply, not alter, the work of the people\\u2019s representatives.

I think of them tonight. Of course, the Supreme Court\\u2019s work is vital not just to a region of the country, but to the whole, vital to the protection of people\\u2019s liberties under law, and to the continuity of our Constitution, the greatest charter of human liberty the world has ever known. \\u201d He further said former Justices Antonin Scalia and Robert Jackson were \\u201ctowering judges\\u201d and Scalia was \\u201ca lion of the law. \\u201d He also praised Justice Byron White, who he worked for, as \\u201cone of the smartest and most courageous men I\\u2019ve ever known. \\u201d Gorsuch also praised Justice Kennedy, who he clerked for, as a man who taught him \\u201cso much. \\u201d Gorsuch further stated, \\u201c[W]hen we judges don our robes, it doesn\\u2019t make us any smarter, but it does serve as a reminder of what\\u2019s expected of us: impartiality and independence, collegiality, and courage. As this process now moves to the Senate, I look forward [to] speaking with members from both sides of the aisle, to answering their questions, and to hearing their concerns. I consider the United States Senate the greatest deliberative body in the world, and I respect the important role the constitution affords it in the confirmation of our judges. I respect, too, the fact that in our legal order, it is for Congress and not the courts to write new laws.
