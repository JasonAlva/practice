However, there are plenty of people who live there who aren t high-rolling actors, singers, producers, and other wealthy Beverly Hills types. There are plenty of everyday folks who live in California, and many are being priced out of their homes and neighborboods. This problem is something that people are attempting to resolve in Costa Mesa, through ordinances regarding development, but one official has a completely heartless  solution  for poor families who cannot afford to live there: move somewhere else.The idea of an ordinance to make a town affordable for a variety of income levels sounds like a good one, right? Well, not to city council members in Costa Mesa. The original idea was that there would be a choice for housing developers: either have some units that almost anyone could afford, or pay the city for the privilege of providing only luxury housing. However, the entire idea has now been shelved. Council member Katrina Foley says of the original idea, which she personally championed: The goal is to try to protect the quality of the community   don t overbuild it, use measured development that is planned and thoughtful. I don t see that we re doing that in any way, shape or form, and we re definitely not providing housing for our workforce. Another member of the Costa Mesa City Council, Sandy Genis, says the ordinance would essentially apply to those developers who somehow benefit from building in Costa Mesa: If we re giving something, we need to get something. If we re going to have a healthy community, we need to have housing for our workers. The thing is, though, the idea for the ordinance in Costa Mesa is not a new one. The ever-increasing costs of living in a place like California mean that, according to records, one-third of cities and counties in California have adopted some form of inclusionary zoning.  As it should. California does not have an asterisk next to its name that says  only rich people welcome. However, Mayor Pro Tem Jim Righeimer is totally heartless on the matter. He says he is, quote,  completely against  affordable housing ordinances, and insists that if people cannot afford Costa Mesa, they need to pick up and go elsewhere: I m going to be very clear, and this is a wakeup call to people: If you cannot afford to live here and your kids can t have decent housing, you should look at where you can afford. That is, of course, the most cold-hearted response to this housing crisis this horrible man could come up with. Does he really think poor families can afford to move across the country at the drop of a hat? Hell, the move itself would cost thousands. That s not even including the part about switching schools for children, finding new jobs, finding places to live in a new location, leaving extended family behind   the list goes on and on.Does this guy even think about what he is saying here? Mr. Righeimer, we re all aware of how expensive California is to live in, and it is that expense that is the problem, not the poor people you want to price out of their homes.You, sir, have no business holding office anywhere if you cannot represent all of your constituents   including the poor ones.Featured image via Mark Boster/Getty Images\",\n          \"BOGOTA  - Negotiating peace with Colombia s largest active rebel group, the ELN, will be tougher than the recent successful talks with FARC guerrillas due to the ELN s diffuse chain of command and radical ideology, the chief government negotiator said.  President Juan Manuel Santos  administration and the National Liberation Army (ELN) in February began negotiations in neighboring Ecuador that seek to end the role the group has played in a five-decade conflict that has left over 220,000 dead and millions displaced.  Even though both sides have agreed to begin a three-month bilateral ceasefire from October, the road to a definitive peace accord will be long and complex, Santos  negotiator, Juan Camilo Restrepo, told Reuters late on Tuesday.   It s a highly radical, ideological group that totally lacks the pragmatism to negotiate that the FARC had,  Restrepo, a 70-year-old former minister, said in the study of his Bogota apartment. The Santos government signed a peace deal with the larger Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia (FARC) in 2016 after negotiations in Havana, Cuba that lasted four years.  Restrepo, a former finance minister, said the ELN s fractured chains of command, plus its greater urban support, were further complications.  All those reasons indicate the negotiation with the ELN is more difficult,  he said.  Inspired by the Cuban revolution and the Liberation Theology of the Catholic priests that founded it in the 1960s, the 2,000-strong ELN has sought peace before, holding talks in Cuba and Venezuela between 2002 and 2007. Both collapsed with little progress.  The ELN is considered a terrorist group by the United States and European Union for engaging in kidnapping, assassinations, drug trafficking, attacks on economic infrastructure and extortion of oil and mining multinationals. Pablo Beltran, the ELN s chief negotiator in Ecuador, has denied there is a weak chain of command and told Reuters last month that the group is united.  During the ceasefire planned from Oct. 1, the ELN has pledged to suspend hostage taking, attacks on roads and oil installations, the use of landmines and the recruitment of minors. In turn, the government agreed to improve protection for community leaders and conditions for about 450 jailed rebels.  There s optimism but not overflowing optimism,  said Restrepo, who returns to the negotiating table in Ecuadorean capital Quito in the next few weeks.  The official warned that although Colombia s military will avoid confrontations with the ELN during the ceasefire, it will go after the group if it engages in criminal activities like illegal mining and drug trafficking.  Such behavior will be repressed with all the strength of the armed forces,  he said.\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"unreliable\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"number\",\n        \"std\": 0,\n        \"min\": 0,\n        \"max\": 1,\n        \"num_unique_values\": 2,\n        \"samples\": [\n          0,\n          1\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"author\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"category\",\n        \"num_unique_values\": 1092,\n        \"samples\": [\n          \"Anne Barnard and Rick Gladstone\",\n          \"Daisuke Wakabayashi and Mike Isaac\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    }\n  ]\n}"

If the people choose Hillary, then they must and will be punished. \\n\\u201cWikileaks: Bill Clinton Boasts of Hillary\\u2019s \\u2018Working Relationship\\u2019 with Muslim Brotherhood,\\u201d By John Hayward , Breitbart, October 26, 2016: \\nIn a speech Bill Clinton gave at the home of Mehul and Hema Sanghani in October 2015, revealed to the public for the first time by WikiLeaks, former President Bill Clinton touted Hillary Clinton\\u2019s \\u201cworking relationship\\u201d with the Muslim Brotherhood \\u2019s Mohamed Morsi in Egypt as an example of her diplomatic skills.President Clinton also gave his wife a lot of credit for negotiating the Iran nuclear deal, in a passage that began with the standard Democrat \\u201cstuff happens\\u201d shrugging defense for foreign policy failures: \\nFinally, we live in a world, as I said, that\\u2019s full of good news and bad news. The United States cannot control it all, but we need a president who\\u2019s most likely to make as many good things happen as possible, and most likely to prevent big, bad things from happening. You can\\u2019t keep every bad thing from happening; who\\u2019s most likely to be able to get people involved in a positive way. Even the people who don\\u2019t like the Iran nuclear agreement concede it never would have happened if it hadn\\u2019t been for the sanctions. Hillary negotiated those sanctions and got China and Russia to sign off \\u2013 something I thought she\\u2019d never be able to do. I confess. I\\u2019m never surprised by anything she does, but that surprised me. I didn\\u2019t think she could do it. The Chinese and the Russians to see past their short-term self-interest to their long-term interest and not sparking another nuclear arms race. \\nAnd when the Muslim Brotherhood took over in Egypt, in spite of the fact that we were (inaudible), she developed a working relationship with the then-president and went there and brokered a ceasefire to stop a full-scale shooting war between Israel and Hamas in Gaza, which on top of what was going on in Syria and the (inaudible) Jordan would have been a calamity for the world. \\nAnd when we were trying to reset our relations with Russia under President Medvedev, she and her team negotiated a New START Treaty, which limits warheads and missiles. And she lobbied it through the Senate. She had to get 67 votes, which means a lot of these Republicans who say that they don\\u2019t like her now are just kidding for election season. They trusted her, and she got it passed. You can\\u2019t get 67 votes in the Senate without a lot of Republican support. And I don\\u2019t know about you, but with all this tension and Mr. Putin trying to affect the outcome of the conflict in Syria, I think it\\u2019s a very good thing that we\\u2019re in a lower risk of any kind of accidental nuclear conflict with the Russians. She did that. \\nYou\\u2019ll rarely find a more tortured political framing of the Iran debacle than Bill Clinton boasting that the sanctions Barack Obama lifted were super-awesome, as even those who don\\u2019t think those sanctions should have been lifted agree. \\nMr. Clinton\\u2019s version of the Iran sanctions leaves out a few details , such as Russia\\u2019s keen financial interest in keeping Iranian energy out of the European market, and China\\u2019s desire to use Iran sanctions as a geopolitical bargaining chip. \\nBut the part about the Muslim Brotherhood is most interesting. If anything, he is selling Hillary Clinton\\u2019s \\u201cworking relationship\\u201d with Egyptian Islamists short, because she used American diplomatic leverage for Morsi\\u2019s benefit even before he got elected, warning Egyptians about \\u201cbacktracking\\u201d to a military regime at a key moment of the post-Mubarak campaign, when Morsi was running against a former member of Hosni Mubarak\\u2019s military. There have long been rumors that more subtle forms of U.S. \\u201c pressure \\u201d were used to secure Morsi\\u2019s office, as well. \\nThen again, in public pronouncements, Clinton called Hosni Mubarak\\u2019s tottering regime \\u201cstable\\u201d and cautioned her Obama Administration colleagues against \\u201cpushing a longtime partner out the door.\\u201d \\nA few days ago, declassified State Department documents revealed Clinton\\u2019s talking points for a 2012 meeting with Morsi hailed his election as a \\u201cmilestone in Egypt\\u2019s transition to democracy,\\u201d and stated that she was to offer the Muslim Brotherhood leader \\u201ctechnical expertise and assistance from both the U.S. government and private sector to support his economic and social programs.\\u201d \\nClinton was also supposed to privately offer Morsi assistance with his police and security forces, which would be conducted \\u201cquite discreetly.\\u201d \\nAfter Morsi was gone, she declared herself exasperated with Egyptian political culture and declared herself a cynical \\u201crealist.\\u201d That is pretty much the opposite of what everyone in the Obama Administration was saying while the \\u201cArab Spring\\u201d was in the midst of springing its little surprises on autocratic but America-aligned (or at least America-fearing) regimes, which we were all supposed to feel guilty about selfishly supporting for so long. \\nAs for Clinton\\u2019s superb working relationship with Morsi, that eventually ended with Morsi\\u2019s wife railing against Clinton for supposedly dismissing him as \\u201ca simpleton who was unfit for the presidency,\\u201d and threatening to publish letters from Clinton to Morsi that would damage the former U.S. Secretary of State. Meanwhile, Mohammed Morsi is developing a solid working relationship with the Egyptian penitentiary system . \\nEgypt has one of those icky military governments again, and while it won\\u2019t have fond memories of Hillary Clinton\\u2019s support for the Muslim Brotherhood regime, it will most likely work with whoever wins the 2016 U.S. presidential election. Therefore, a prospective President Hillary Clinton probably won\\u2019t suffer too much from Secretary of State Hillary Clinton\\u2019s appalling lapses in judgment. \\nArticle reposted with permission from PamelaGeller.com\",\n          \"WASHINGTON  - U.S. Attorney General Loretta Lynch said on Friday she understands how her meeting with former president Bill Clinton \\u201ccasts a shadow\\u201d over the perception of independence in the investigation her department is conducting into his wife\\u2019s email use.  Bill Clinton met with Lynch on her plane in Phoenix on Monday night, triggering a firestorm from Republicans and a public statement from Lynch that she will accept whatever outcome independent investigators decide at the end of the probe into the Democratic presidential front-runner\\u2019s use of a private email server.\",\n          \"During a private meeting of the most senior Republican senators, GOP leaders  laughed out loud at the idea that Trump s border wall would ever be built. The explosive revelation comes from Laura Ingraham s new book, Billionaire at the Barricades: The Populist Revolution from Reagan to Trump.Ingraham reports that her source  was there in the room  when it happened and that the sordid episode is  a reminder that the populist movement that delivered Trump into office must remain vigilant and keep the heat on the GOP Establishment. The bestselling author and new Fox News primetime host argues that Republicans will pay an enormous political price if the GOP Establishment succeeds in torpedoing President Trump s border wall. Mark these words: If a wall a physical wall is not erected along our southern border, the president and his party will pay a severe political price,  writes Ingraham. She added:  Like George Bush s promise to  Read [his] lips: no new taxes,  the promise of a border wall was a searing pledge to the American people. Billionaire at the Barricades also dismantles arguments against the cost of erecting the border wall.The notion that Congress can t find $25 billion the higher end estimated cost of building the wall in our nearly $4 trillion annual budget is absurd. Democrats have never met a spending or building project they didn t like. But now all of a sudden they re fiscal hawks? Get real. And the Establishment Republicans who cowered in the corner for eight years while Obama nearly doubled the national debt to $19 trillion dollars now expect us to believe they re courageous penny-pinchers?

Witnesses say that the 20-year-old group home resident lost control of his basketball. The ball brushed against a nearby car.The owner of the vehicle, who has since been identified as 28-year-old Roderick Town, aggressively confronted Cole.During an interview with WJLA, Prince George County Police Chief Hank Stawinski described what happened next: The special needs individual is not communicating clearly. The individual in the car retrieves a weapon and shoots the person a number of times. Stawinski called the shooting  a senseless murder. After killing the special needs man, Town fled the scene.He was arrested on Saturday. Town faces charges of first-degree and second-degree murder, as well as additional charges.Here s more on the story from WJLA.According to the Washington Post, Maryland has  some of the strictest gun laws in the nation. The state s supposedly strict gun laws do nothing to keep guns out of the hands of domestic abusers, convicted felons or people on the FBI s terrorist watch list. Democrats have been trying to change that.Police have yet to release information on what type of gun was used in this senseless killing, nor have they disclosed whether Town was legally permitted to own a gun in MD.What we do know is that contrary to NRA myths, the presence of a gun does not reduce the odds of violent crime.Time and time again we see minor arguments escalate to this level of violence. As decades of research shows, the mere presence of a gun during a heated conflict contributes to higher levels of aggression and violence.Guns and anger are a deadly combination. Sadly, research also shows that the more angry and impulsive a person is, the more likely they are to own and carry a gun.As reported here: A June 2015 study found that  310 million firearms estimated to be in private hands in the United States are disproportionately owned by people who are prone to angry, impulsive behavior and have a potentially dangerous habit of keeping their guns close at hand. While no one has all the answers when it comes to preventing gun violence, we do know that putting even more guns into the hands of angry people is not the solution.Image credit: video screen capture via WJLA\",\n          \"WASHINGTON  - Republican presidential front-runner Donald Trump, fresh off a string of election victories, said on Wednesday he was confident he would get enough delegates to win his party\\u2019s nomination and warned of unrest if it were denied to him.
